# Replacement Raspberry Pi litterbox controller

I have one of the [five-hundred-dollar Litter Robots](https://www.litter-robot.com/litter-robot-3.html) that seem to have the worst logic. My tiny five-pound kitty is most often ignored, while the fat one doesn't trigger a cycle upon his leaving it. I figured I'd put together a replacement board for it, with a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a few sensors.

## Status

This is very much work in progress - code is close to done, hardware is practically ready on the breadboard, but nothing is hooked up to the actual litter box.
